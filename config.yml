        Title: Welcome the *[New CheckBook DApp](./app)*!
        Content: >
            ðŸŒŸBlockchain cheque is a new airdrop tool which borrowed some features from paper cheques. We implement it as a DApp on smartBCH, hoping it to be a useful tool as part of smartBCH's infrastructure.

            - ðŸŒŸWe would like to invite a lot people to use blockchain cheques on smartBCH. The means to do it, as you can guess, is airdropping some coins to the people, through blockchain cheques.

            - ðŸŒŸThis site promotes the adoption of blockchain cheques. The progress of airdropping is traced here.

            - ðŸŒŸWe just released a *[new version of CheckBook DApp](./app)* which is more beautiful and easier to use.
