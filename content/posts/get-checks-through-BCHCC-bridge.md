To test the new version of [CheckBook DApp](https://www.checkbook.cash/app) with generally-supported encrypted memos, we are giving out checks together with [bchcc.cash](https://www.bchcc.cash), a BCH-to-smartBCH bridge.

The rule is simple: for each cross-chain transfer through [bchcc.cash](https://www.bchcc.cash), a check with some $CATS will also be sent to the receiver of cross-chain BCH. The rule does not take the status of the receiver into account. And the count is not limited: a receiver can get multiple checks if she transferred BCH through BCHCC.cash for multiple times.

The check's $CATS amount is decided by the current $CATS price and a pseudo-random factor. At most cases, the value you get is a bit less than your paid cross-chain fee. But in some lucky cases, you can get more.

Good Luck in getting your checks!
